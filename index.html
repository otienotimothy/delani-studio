						Before we sign a contract or write a line of code, our team will
						spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision.

						The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level
						statement of work.
					</p>
					<p>
						Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or
						just pieces you need.
